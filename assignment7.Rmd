```{r, first dataset}
mortality <- read.csv("data/xmart.csv")

##Removing extra spaces
mortality[,3] <-gsub(" ","", mortality[,3]) 

##Renaming colnames for later
names(mortality) <- c("Country","Year","mm_ratio","births_attended")

##Extracting bounds
mortality$lower_bound <- str_split_fixed(str_extract(mortality[,3],"\\[[ 0-9 -]+\\]"), "-", 2)[,1]
mortality$upper_bound <- str_split_fixed(str_extract(mortality[,3],"\\[[ 0-9 -]+\\]"), "-", 2)[,2]

##Removing brackets
mortality$lower_bound <- as.integer(gsub("\\[", "", mortality$lower_bound))
mortality$upper_bound <- as.integer(gsub("\\]","", mortality$upper_bound))

##Removing bounds from col3
mortality[,3] <- as.integer(gsub("\\[[ 0-9 -]+\\]", "", mortality[,3]))
```

```{r, second dataset}
gni <- read.csv("data/WHS9_93.csv", skip=1, as.is = TRUE, check.names = FALSE)

##Removing extra spaces from & changing class of 2013 to integer
gni[,2] <-as.integer(gsub(" ","", gni[,2]))

##Tidying data: Using gather to have one entry per country per year
gni <- gni %>%
  gather(Year, income, 2:25)
```

```{r, merging data}

##Merging the two files, retaining only rows which have per capita income & maternal mortality or attended births
merged <- merge(gni,mortality) %>%
  filter(!is.na(income)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(mm_ratio) | !is.na(births_attended))

```

- Make a two polished  and informative graphs, one relating income to maternal mortality and the other relating income to percentage attended births
```{r, graphs}

## Plotting Maternal Mortality vs Income
plot1 <- merged %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=mm_ratio, y=income, color = Year)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() + scale_color_ptol() + labs(title ="Maternal Mortality Versus Gross National Income", y="Gross National Income", x="Maternal Mortality Ratio", color = "Year")
plot1

## Plotting % of Attended Births vs Income
plot2 <- merged %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=births_attended, y=income, color = Year)) + geom_point() + theme_minimal() + scale_color_ptol() + labs(title ="Attended Births vs Gross National Income", y="Gross National Income", x="% of Attended Births", color = "Year")
plot2

##Want to identify some countries in the plots, will do later
```


```{r saving file}

## Saving merged & cleaned dataframe in data folder
write_csv(merged, "data/income.mortality.csv")
```


```{r, choropleth}
## Using aggregate to use most recent year for each country
choromerge <- merge(merged,aggregate(Year ~ Country, merged, max))

## Changing region names to lower to match region requirements for choropleth
choromerge[,1] <- str_to_lower(choromerge[,1])

##Checking which countries do not match the proper format
data(country.regions)
missing <- anti_join(choromerge, country.regions, by =c("Country" = "region"))

## ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE WAY TO DO THIS BUT UNTIL I MANAGE OTHERWISE, renaming some of the countries to follow the correct format.....
## Should be done by matching a section of characters between the two data frames and renaming the country names by the country.regions names -- I think. 
choromerge[8,1] = "the bahamas"
choromerge[173,1] = "vietnam"
choromerge[166,1] = "united kingdom"
choromerge[172,1] = "venezuela"
choromerge[155,1] = "east timor"
choromerge[154,1] = "macedonia"

##Regardless of whether the country names match what is available in the country.regions dataframe -- choropleth is saying that I'm missing more regions than are showing up in the missing dataframe??

##Choropleth
choromerge %>%
  dplyr::rename(value = mm_ratio, region = Country) %>%
  country_choropleth(title ="title")


```
